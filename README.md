# Classification-of-Cardiac-Arrhythmia
My first Github project! It is a classic machine learning project for classifying whether a person has some degree of cardiac arrhythmia.
The dataset has only 452 records and 280 features. You will see in the Jupyter Notebook that the classes of the target variable are highly imbalanced. So we don't expect to see impressive classification metrics, but let's see how well we can do!
